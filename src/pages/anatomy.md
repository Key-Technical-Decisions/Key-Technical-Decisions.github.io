A KTD in essence is a document. It is designed to maximise the information recording for decision making for the purpose of documentation, communication and clarification of a business technical decision.

It includes clear and useful approaches to simplify the notation of values like the semaphore signalling of pros/cons.

It brings people together facilitating discussion of ideas and documenting a path to the best solution through a simple but structured process.
